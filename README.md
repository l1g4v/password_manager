A very simple password manager
I don't know if this is safe at all but it was fun to make
I did it as a "practice" for what I learnt about AES and RSA
it doesn't have the best UI but it does the work lol

the most unsafe thing in my opinion is how the password is stored in
"raw text" but I dont have idea of how to make that more secure

why javascript? yeah js for security applications is not the best thing
but I wanted something cross-platformÂ¿

proper docs?: I'm too lazy
